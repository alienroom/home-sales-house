                <h2>1. Search for the right price</h2>
                <p>
                  Price will ultimately dictate what you can or 
                  cannot buy. While looking at homes above your price range can be fun, it’s not a 
                  good use of time — and it can lead to heartbreak when you realize it’s not 
                  financially feasible. Despite this, our research found that in 2019, just 
                  55% of buyers stayed on budget, while 26% went over their initial budget.

                <h2>2. Prioritize the location Next to budget</h2>
                <p>
                  Location is one of the most important things to consider when buying a house.
                   The 2019 report uncovered that 24% of buyers found it difficult or extremely difficult
                   to find a home in their desired location. If you can’t find or afford 
                   a home in your ideal neighborhood, you’ll want to ask yourself a few 
                   questions (and enlist the help of your agent) to find a location that 
                   fits your lifestyle, needs and budget. Remember — your home’s location 
                   can’t be changed, so take the time to really identify a neighborhood where you’ll be happy live.

                <h2>3. Think long term</h2>
                <p>
                  According to the Housing Group Report USA, the typical homeowner stays in their home for 
                  14 years before selling. When shopping for a home, don’t just think of your immediate
                  needs. Make sure the home you select will meet your long-term goals, so you won’t 
                  have to move again in the near future.

                Finding a house you want to buy can be an exciting time. The house looks great in the photos,
                it feels right when you visit, it seems like this is ‘the one.’ But many houses hide darker 
                secrets that might not be immediately obvious. How can you be sure there are no nasty surprises 
                in store? It’s easy to get carried away. You view the house in person and you can already picture 
                where your things may go. The neighborhood seems great, and the price is right. But is it too good 
                to be true? There’s no need to worry. Some houses may come with hidden surprises, but a 
                little vigilance before you buy can prevent you from falling into an expensive trap. For
                example, buying expert Arlene Reckson suggests checking how many other houses on the street 
                are up for sale. If there are many, you might want to check to see if there are any local
                issues causing people to move away. Inside the house, you should keep an eye out for moisture 
                problems or leaks. We recommend having a moisture meter on hand, so if you spot soft-looking
                wood you can take a reading to assess how bad it may be. Ideally, you want a reading that
                comes in at under 16%, but if it’s under 28% there’s still a chance to fix, and you’ll be
                glad you raised the issue with the sellers before exchanging contracts! check this easy to 
                reference visual guide of what to look for while you visit prospective houses.There’s nothing
                quite like the feeling of buying a new home. The expert tips provided will ensure you’re
                empowered with the tools and information to find a home that’s safe, sound, and ready to move in!
